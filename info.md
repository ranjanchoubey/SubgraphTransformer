## Summary

### Data Processing

- Loading the Cora dataset.
- Partitioning the graph into subgraphs using METIS.

### Embedding Computation

- Computing GCN embeddings for each subgraph.
- Computing Laplacian positional embeddings for each subgraph.
- Using mean pooling to get subgraph-level embeddings.

### Model Architecture

- Implementing a Graph Transformer model that takes token embeddings and Laplacian positional embeddings as input.
- Adding the token embeddings and Laplacian positional embeddings instead of concatenating them.

### Training and Evaluation

- Training the Graph Transformer model using the computed embeddings.
- Evaluating the model on the test dataset.

### Debugging and Optimization

- Addressing issues related to the backward pass and ensuring that the model is learning correctly.
- Ensuring that the embeddings are fixed and not passed through additional layers for dimension adjustment.

## Next Steps

To ensure that everything is working correctly and to improve the performance of your model, you might consider the following steps:

### Verify Data Preprocessing

- Ensure that the data is being preprocessed correctly and that the subgraphs are correctly partitioned.

### Check Embedding Computation

- Verify that the GCN and Laplacian positional embeddings are being computed correctly.

### Model Training

- Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- Ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting.

### Debugging

- Add debugging statements to check the intermediate outputs and gradients.
- Ensure that the backward pass is only called once per forward pass.

### Performance Tuning

- Experiment with different model architectures and configurations to improve performance.

### Node-Level Prediction and Loss Computation

- **Node-Level Prediction**: The model predicts a label for each node.
- **Loss Calculation**: The loss is computed based on the node-level predictions and the true labels of the nodes.
